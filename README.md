Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my tech portfolio! I'm a self-driven IT support specialist and cybersecurity student with a background in running mobile tech and food service businesses. I use this space to document hands-on labs, real-world projects, and freelance-style work I've done through my ventures.
 ðŸ”§ Key Areas:
- Cybersecurity Labs (TryHackMe, Wireshark, Vulnerability Scans)
- IT Support & Networking (PowerShell, Bash, Network Setup)
- Small Business Tech Projects (POS setup, CRM, inventory tools)
